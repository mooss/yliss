** About mathematical rigour

The maths presented here will be hand-wavy most of the time and a lot of it will not be formally proved because I'm a lazy bastard who mostly want to program.
So do not expect much rigour.

** About C++ developpment

I try to follow the C++ core guidelines[fn::See https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines.] when it suits me.

The C++ code presented here will go inside the namespace =octa= and tangled to =include/octasierp.h=.

* Of octahedrons and Sierpiński triangles

This document is about octasierps, fractal solids destined to be used as the basis for a procedurally generated planet.

An octasierp is the brainchild of a regular octahedron and the Sierpiński triangle, the first is the platonic solid formed of 8 equilateral triangles and the second is a recursive subdivision of an equilateral triangle.
Indeed, since each face of an octahedron is an equilateral triangle, it can be divided into 4 smaller equilateral triangles which can themselves be divided and so on, thus adapting the concept of Sierpiński triangles to the third dimension.

This recursive structure is caracterised by its degree $d \in \mathbb{N}$, which is the number of successive subdivisions necessary to construct it.
The simplest octasierp occurs when $d=0$ and corresponds to an octahedron.

** Goals

This is my second attempt at generating a procedural planet using an octahedron as the starting point.

The main problem I encountered last time was finding a good data structure for my subdivided octahedron as well as implementing the code to get the neighbours of a point.
I ended up using a convoluted approach that I can't even remember now, and thankfully I don't have to since I've collected some observations that will help me to build a much simpler and intuitive data structure than last time.

A good data structure for an octasierp must meet some criteria:
 - A coordinate system, both for mental representation and as a programming primitive.
 - A support for different levels of detail, meaning the possibility to further subdivise the structure without having to reconstruct the whole object.
 - A fast way to request the neighbours of a point.

# Note: those goals are not static, the definition of a good data structure will probably expand when I'll get a better grasp on the problem.

** Geometric visualisation

I think an appropriate first step to find the best underlying representation of an octasierp is to visualise the problem, since the subject of study is a geometric concept.

*** Octahedron net

An octahedron can be represented in two dimensions as a net, a flattened arrangement of the eight sides, ready to be folded back into three dimensions.
For an illustration of both the subdivision process and the net of an octahedron, extended to an octasierp, see figure [[montage_octa_degree_0-3]].

#+name: montage_octa_degree_0-3
#+caption: Octasierp net for degrees 0, 1, 2 and 3
[[file:images/montage_net_octa_degree_0-3.png]]

*** Squarified net

An interesting property of octasierps is that when you inflate the central angle to 90\textdegree{}, they can almost be represented as a square grid with additional diagonal connections as shown in figure [[montage_squa_degree_0-3]].
A strange thing about this representation is that points are neighbouring each other along the sides in a symmetric pattern.
This representation is strongly reminiscent of the Peirce quincuncial projection[fn::See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peirce_quincuncial_projection.], all the more because the end goal of this project is to generate a planet.

#+name: montage_squa_degree_0-3
#+caption: Octasierp squarified net for degrees 0, 1, 2 and 3
[[file:images/montage_net_squa_degree_0-3.png]]

**** Four quarters

We can divise the squarified net into four quarter, each being a rotated image of the others around the central point.
This means rules devised for one quarter can easily be adapted to the others.

Those quarters are identified by a number ranging from zero to three, with quarter 0 being the top-right one and the others being numerated counter-clockwise.
The counter-clockwise rotation has been chosen to correspond to the sense of trigonometric rotation.

**** Two poles and four corners

To pay hommage to both the planet metaphor and the peirce quincuncial projection, the central point is the north pole, while the four extremes are one and the same, the south pole.

The four midpoints of the sides are actually just random points on the equator but since they also are initial vertices of the octasierp, let's give them a name ; the four corners of the world, with the right one being corner 0 and the others numerated once again counter-clockwise.
I know that the four corners are a bit confusing because from the 2d perspective of the squarified net, the corners of the square are actually the south pole but it will make more sense in 3d and I really like the term, so it stays.

** Coordinate system

Based on the observation of the squarified net, the natural coordinate system for an octasierp is an indexing along the axis between corners 1 and 3 (the x-axis) and the one between corners 2 and 0 (the y-axis).
In this scheme, the point of coordinates $(0, 0)$ is the north pole.

Since an octasierp is a discrete structure, the coordinates will be integer-based.
An unfortunate side effect of integer coordinates is that except for the north pole, points will not keep their coordinates when the degree of subdivision changes.
For example when $degree = 0$, corner 0 is at the coordinates $(1, 0)$ and when $degree = 1$ it is at the coordinates $(2, 0)$.
In the end, the rule is that coordinates only make sense at a given degree.

Another problem is that there is a redundancy in this coordinate system that needs to be resolved (most strikingly, the south pole is present four times).
First we will need to derive the cardinality of a half-axis, that is to say the number of points on it.
Then that property will be used to describe precisely the redundancy problem.
Finally, I will present the solution I opted for to resolve the situation and fix the coordinate system.

*** Half-axis cardinality

To pass from degree $d$ to degree $d + 1$, points are inserted between every adjacent point.
From degree 0 to degree 1, 1 point is added, from degree 1 to 2, 2 points are inserted, then 4, then 8, then $2^4$, then $2^5$, and so on.
Another way to see it is that the number of points added at degree $d + 1$ is the number of segments at degree $d$ ; we start with one segment to subdivise, then two, then four and so on.

Based on what we have deduced so far, we can express this number, with the relation $\vert points_{d+1} \vert = \vert points_d \vert + 2^{d}$ with $d \in \mathbb{N}$.
The problem is that I don't know anymore how to process this kind of recurrence relationships and I can't be bothered to find how so let's just make a hasardous guess from the first five numbers, shown in table [[hasardous_guess]].
A most interesting pattern made evident by this table is that in each line we add $2^d$ to itself, plus one.
Thus we deduce that $\vert points_{d+1} \vert = 2 \times 2^d + 1 \Leftrightarrow \vert points_{d+1} \vert = 2^{d+1} + 1 \Leftrightarrow \vert points_d \vert = 2^{d} + 1$.

#+name: hasardous_guess
#+caption: Small amount of data to support my dubious claim (no mathematicians were hurt in the process (don't quote me on that))
| $d$ | $\vert points_d \vert$ | $2^{d}$ | $\vert points_{d+1} \vert$ |
|-----+------------------------+---------+----------------------------|
|   0 |                      2 |       1 |                          3 |

Translated in c++, this gives us:
#+name: octa namespace
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
std::size_t extreme(std::size_t degree){
    return (std::size_t(1) << degree) + 1;
}
#+END_SRC

*** Points redundancy

A peculiar caracteristic of the squarified-net-inspired coordinate system is that there is a redundancy at the edges, where the four corners act as a center of symmetry.
For example, the points $(2, -1)$ and $(2, 1)$ at degree 1 are one and the same.
We can deduce a general rule from this example.

First we need to find what are the extreme values of our coordinate system at a given degree.
The extreme value we are looking for here will be the number of points on an half-axis minus one, since the numerotation starts at 0.
We already know the number of points on a half-axis at degree $d$ to be $\vert points_d \vert = 2^{d} + 1$ so the extreme value we are looking for is $2^d$.

Since the center of symmetry are the four corners we deduce the following rules for the redundant points at degree $d$, centered around:
 - *corner 0*: $\{(2^d, n), (2^d, -n)\}$
 - *corner 1*: $\{(n, 2^d), (-n, 2^d)\}$
 - *corner 2*: $\{(-2^d, n), (-2^d, -n)\}$
 - *corner 3*: $\{(n, -2^d), (-n, -2^d)\}$
With $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 \leq n \leq 2^d$, so technically the centers of symmetry are included (when $n=0$).
Note that a special case arise when $n=2^d$, where the redundant points - for all the corners - are the south pole.

*** Border disputes and canonical quarters

Because there are redundancies in the coordinate system, it will be useful to define the canonical quarter of a redundant point, that is to say the one to which they "officially" belong.
Two main cases need to be treated:
 - The poles because they are on every quarter.
 - The borders between quarters (excluding the poles) because they are shared between two quarters.

There is only two poles, so they cannot be distributed equally between the four quarters.
Rather that attributing one pole to, say the quarter 0 and another to the quarter 2, I prefer to give them both to quarter 0 because:
 1. it is more memorable, and
 2. it gets the message across that quarter 0 is the reference quarter, or The canonical quarter, if you will.

Because quarter 1, 2 and 3 are essentially a rotation of quarter 0, we resolve the border dispute between quarters by using this property.
The top and bottom border of quarter 0, i.e. its border with quarter 1 and quarter 3 respectively are attributed to quarter 0.
By rotation, every border has its quarter and every quarter has its border.

Beyond those two cases we just resolved lurks a third one, the corners.
Even though they technically belong to the borders, the rotation mecanism would still make them shared between quarters because there would be two corners per quarter while there is the same number of corners and quarters (4).
To solve this last issue, we'll just say that the bottom right corner belongs to quarter 0 and as always, this rule applies by rotation to the other quarters.

* Memory representation

Now that the bases of the coordinate system are solidified, the next step is to build a structure that can hold a value for each valid coordinates.
The challenge here is that an octasierp can *almost* be reduced to a square grid, which is the polite way to say can it *cannot* be reduced to a square grid.

This is unfortunate because a square grid is excessively easy to represent in memory.
Had an octasierp been a square of side $n$, we would have used an array of $n \times n$ values and fetched the value of coordinate $(x, y)$ at the index $x \times n + y$.

Since we cannot do that, I will at first present the structure I choosed, that is to say how the points of one quarter are stored.
Then I will explain the corresponding indexing scheme, that is to say how to find a point corresponding to a given coordinate.
Finally, this representation will be expanded to the full octahedron (the three other quarters).

** Structure

One of the goals previously set is to support different levels of detail, thus the basic structure will hold the points at a given degree and a collection of this structure will form a quarter.

This notably means that given the coordinates of one point inside the quarter, we need to find the degree at which it first appeared before accessing it.
This is linked with what I called the binary degree of a number.

*** Binary degree

We can simplify the problem of finding the degree of appearance of a point by going from a rectangle grid to discrete points on a line.
We will explore this simplification in this section, with a short detour through 1-dimension territory.

At degree 0, there are two points (table [[bindeg_x0]]), at degree 1 one more point appears (table [[bindeg_x1]]), at degree 2 there are two more points (table [[bindeg_x2]]), four more at degree 3 (table [[bindeg_x3]]), then eight, then sixteen, and so on.
An interesting thing to note here is that since a point is introduced in between two adjacent points, a point's index is doubled at each subdivision so what is point 1 at subdivision degree 1 becomes point 4 at subdivision degree 3, thanks to two consecutive multiplications.

I named $bindeg_{i,d}$ (binary degree) the function outputting the degree of appearance of a point when given its index $i$ and a global degree of subdivision $d$.
We have $i \in \mathbb{N}$ and $d \in \mathbb{N}$, with $0 \leq i \leq 2^d$.
In my (rather uninformed) opinion, it behaves as some kind of weird distance between $i$ and $2^d$, in that it is inversely proportional to the number of times the index can be divided by two while being bounded by $d$.

We can enumerate the binary degrees relatives to $2^3 = 8$ like so (this is just another way to present the data from table [[bindeg_x3]]):
 - $0 = bindeg_{0,3} = bindeg_{8, 3}$
 - $1 = bindeg_{4,3}$
 - $2 = bindeg_{2,3} = bindeg_{6,3}$
 - $3 = bindeg_{1,3} = bindeg_{3,3} = bindeg_{5,3} = bindeg_{7,3}$

The key observation is that the points with the highest binary degree are all the odd ones.
This phenomena can be explained by construction:
 - When going from degree $d - 1$ to degree $d$, we insert a new point between the first two points.
 - This new point is now point $1$ and the points to its right are increased by $1$.
 - The next point will insert itself at the right of what was the odd point $1$ but now is the even point $2$ and we find ourselves in the initial case, we are inserting the new point into a odd position, thus moving the next point into an even position.
 - This situation repeats itself until the end of the sequence and explains why a point's index doubles every subdivision.

We now have at our disposition three elements which can be used to construct a definition for the binary degree:
 1. The first and last indexes, $0$ and $2^d$ always appears at degree $0$ ($bindeg_{0, d} = bindeg_{2^d, d} = 0$).
 2. Indexes are multiplied by two every subdivision, while their degree of appearance stays the same ($bindeg_{i,d} = bindeg_{2i, d + 1}$).
 3. Odd indexes have the maximal binary degree ($i \bmod 2 = 1 \implies bindeg_{i, d} = d$).


From 1., we have the initial values.
From 3., we have the values of odd points.
By combining 2. and 3., we can deduce the values of the other even points, because 2. is equivalent to $i \bmod 2 = 0 \implies bindeg_{i,d} = bindeg_{\frac{i}{2},d-1}$, thus we can divise even values until they are odd to obtain their binary degree.

A naive C++ implementation will look like this:
#+name: Naive bindeg
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
unsigned int naive_bindeg(unsigned int index, unsigned int degree){
    if(index % 2 == 1 || degree == 0)
        return degree;
    return naive_bindeg(index >> 1, degree - 1);
}
#+END_SRC

The following minimal test should output data matching with table [[bindeg_x3]].
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp :includes <iostream> :eval no-export :wrap "src text" :exports both
<<Naive bindeg>>
int main(){
    unsigned int degree = 3;
    auto rightmost = 1 << degree;
    for(unsigned int i = 0; i <= rightmost; ++i){
        std::cout << "bindeg(" << i << "," << degree << ") = " << naive_bindeg(i, degree) << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_src text
bindeg(0,3) = 0
bindeg(1,3) = 3
bindeg(2,3) = 2
bindeg(3,3) = 3
bindeg(4,3) = 1
bindeg(5,3) = 3
bindeg(6,3) = 2
bindeg(7,3) = 3
bindeg(8,3) = 0
#+END_src

The binary degree function will be fundamental to point indexation in an octasierp and can probably be optimised using =<strings.h>='s =ffs= (find first set).

* Diagrams generation

The diagrams are generated in python, using =gizeh= for the geometry and =moviepy= for stiching images together into animations, inspired by this [[http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/09/20/vector-animations-with-python/][blogpost]].

They can be installed via pip:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :eval never
pip install --user gizeh moviepy
#+END_SRC


Images are saved in the =images= folder and the scripts are supposed to be executed from the root of the project like so:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./scripts/your-favorite-script.sh
#+END_SRC

** Colors

I use a =SimpleNamespace= to store some colors that I want to use (the names are probably innacurate).
The obvious alternative would be to use a =class= but that would be tedious to initialize, or a =dict= but I want to be able to access members through the dot operator.

#+name: Colors
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python

colors = SimpleNamespace(
    canard=(0, .6, .6),
    turquoise=(0, 1, 1),

    mandarine=(1, .8, 0),
    purple=(.4, 0, .4),
    violet=(.6, .2, .6),
    black=(0, 0, 0),
    evergrey=(.5, .5, .5),
    white=(1, 1, 1),

    ocean=(0, .2, .8),
    river=(0, .4, .8),

)

Here are some color palettes:

** Geometric primitives

The class =Geometry= is here to provide an abstraction about the way a subdivided object is to be drawn.
For the moment, geometric primitives only have two caracteristics at a given degree of subdivision :
 - their color as a tuple of three or four floats =(r, g, b)= or =(r, g, b, a)=, and
 - their size as a factor by which to multiply a reference size.

Thus, =Geometry= is initialised with:
 - a color palette (a list of colors), and
 - a size policy (a function $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$).

The geometry parameters for degree $d$ can then simply be obtained with square brackets indexing (like =geometry[d]=), thanks to the method =__getitem__=.

#+name: Geometric primitives
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python
class Geometry(object):
    def __init__(self,
                 degree,
                 color_palette=[(0, 0, 0)],
                 size_policy=None
    ):
        self.color_palette = color_palette
        if size_policy is None:
            self.size_policy = decrease_size_linearly(degree)
        else:
            self.size_policy = size_policy

    def __getitem__(self, current):
        return self.color_palette[current % len(self.color_palette)],\
            self.size_policy(current)
#+END_SRC

*** Decrease size linearly

The default element size policy is to decrease the size of a primitive linearly with the degree of subdivision.
Thus, the aim of this policy is to provide a factor $factor_{current}$ by which to multiply an initial size such that $1 \geq factor_{current} \geq minFactor$, where $current$ is the current degree of subdivision.

We know that $factor_0 = 1$ and $factor_{degree} = minFactor$.
Since we want to decrease the size linearly, we also know that $factor_{current} = a \times current + b$, thus

$\begin{cases}
  a \times 0 + b = 1 & \Leftrightarrow b = 1\\
  a \times degree + b = minFactor & \Leftrightarrow a = \frac{minFactor -1}{degree}
\end{cases}$

We finally obtain the function $factor_{current} = \frac{minFactor - 1}{degree} \times current + 1$.
This function is not defined when $degree = 0$ so this need to be addressed as a special case.

After playing a bit with $minFactor$ value, it looks like .25 is a good value.

#+name: Geometric primitives
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python
def decrease_size_linearly(degree, min_factor=.25):
    def result(current):
        if degree == 0:
            return 1
        return current * (min_factor - 1) / degree + 1
    return result

** Triangle
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:jupyter-python+: :eval never
:END:

A =Triangle= represents one of the triangles of an octasierp net, its properties are:
#+attr_latex: :float left :center nil
| -- =degree=:        | The degree of subdivision.                              |

| -- =points=:        | =Geometry= object describing how points are to be drawn |
| -- =lines=:         | =Geometry= object describing how lines are to be drawn  |

A =Triangle= has no coordinate of its own because the coordinates of its constituent points will be used in =generate=, whose role is to create a Gizeh object representing the geometry of the triangle, whereas =geometry= does the recursive calculations regarding all the points and lines of the final figure.

#+name: Triangle
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python

<<Geometric primitives>>

class Triangle(object):
    def __init__(self, degree, initial_width, points=None, lines=None):
        self.degree = degree
        self.initial_width = initial_width
        if points is None:
            self.points = Geometry(degree)
        else:
            self.points = points
        if lines is None:
            self.lines = Geometry(degree)
        else:
            self.lines = lines

    def generate(self, a, b, c):
        points, lines = self.geometry(a, b, c)
        return gz.Group(lines + points)

    def geometry(self, a, b, c, current=0):
        <<Initiate triangle geometry>>
        <<Subdivise triangle>>
#+END_SRC

*** Initiate triangle geometry
We use the =Geometry= object instanciated in the constructor to get the color and deduce the line width at the current degree, making sure that it is at least 1.

#+name: Initiate triangle geometry
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python
color, factor = self.lines[current]
width = max(1, self.initial_width * factor)
#+END_SRC

The initial triangle is simply three lines joining the three points, kept in a list that will eventually hold the subsequent triangles.
#+name: Initiate triangle geometry
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python
lines = [gz.polyline(
    [a, b, c, a],
    stroke_width=width,
    stroke=color
)]
#+END_SRC

The same idea is repeated to create an initial point, scaled a bit ($\times 1.2$) because their original use is to hide the corners of lines:
#+name: Initiate triangle geometry
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python
color, factor = self.points[current]
width = max(1, self.initial_width * factor * 1.2)
point = gz.circle(r=width, fill=color)
#+END_SRC

This point was spawned at the default location of (0, 0), we use it to create the vertices of our triangle by translation:
#+name: Initiate triangle geometry
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python
points = list(map(point.translate, (a, b, c)))
#+END_SRC

*** Subdivise triangle

Now that the geometric elements have been dealt with, only the recursive calls - or lack thereof - remains.
The generation is over when the maximal degree has been reached:
#+name: Subdivise triangle
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python
if current == self.degree:
    return points, lines

Otherwise, we make recursive calls to =geometry=, using the midpoints of the three original points.
The order of the points and of the lines is important because the graphical elements are drawn in the order of their apparition and we want to make sure that the earliest subdivisions are written over the subsequent ones.

** Octasierp net

=Octanet= represent the net of an octasierp through its evolution to a quasi-squaregrid.
=make_surface= is the interface for the external world to generate the gizeh surface containing the desired octanet.

#+END_SRC

*** Net construction according to progress

=Octanet='s evolution is tracked through the =progress= parameter of =make_net=:
 - when $progress = 0$, it's octahedron net shaped,
 - when $progress = 1$ it's quasi-squaregrid shaped, and
 - when $0 < progress < 1$ the shape is deduced by interpolating the value of the central angle.
A triangle is then generated at the desired degree of subdivision and rotated to form the first quarter of the figure.
Finally this quarter is cloned and rotated three times to form the complete figure.

:PROPERTIES:

This section contains the implementation of the class used to produce the various ASCII-style representations of squarified-net quarters.
The arguments are self-explanatory if you've read the section [[Of octahedrons and Sierpiński triangles]].
Except for =appearance= which is actually the degree of appearance (=degree= is of course the degree of subdivision).

The inclusion of =appearance= in the arguments means that only points appearing at the degree =appearance= are included in the representation.
I'll explain later how to make a representation including all the points or only the points in a given list.

class Quarter:
    <<Textual quarter constants>>

    def __init__(self, degree, appearance=None, quarter=0):
        self.degree = degree
        self.appearance = appearance
        self.quarter = quarter % 4

** Character set

The character set used to describe a quarter is not supposed to be changed, that's why it is defined at the class level.

#+name: Textual quarter constants
#+BEGIN_SRC python
POINT = 'x'
HORIZONTAL = '-'
EMPTY = ' '
VERTICAL = '|'
CORNER = '+'
COLLISION = 'E'
#+END_SRC

** Generate a raw representation

This method is the core of the text representation logic.
Its role is to create a string where every character except =\\n= maps to the real corresponding point.
It should not be called by an end user, as it still needs to be prettyfied and it has its own =appearance= argument which restricts the representation to one specific degree of appearance.
The assembly steps required will be the subject of the next sections.

With that being said, this method is a perfect example of why designing code using (poorly) observed artifacts rather than carefully deduced mathematical knowledge will result in a terrible unmaintanable mess.
But hey, it works.

In retrospect, it would have been much better to start from the central point since it is obviously a center of symmetry.
Even with that in mind, I will not bother redesigning the code below because once again hey, it works^{tm}.
If you don't understand how this code works, don't worry, neither do I.

#+name: Textual quarter methods
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def raw(self, appearance=None):
    # Length of the sides.
    length = pow(2, self.degree) + 1

    # Special case without points.
    if appearance is None:
        topbottom = self.CORNER + self.HORIZONTAL * (length - 2) + self.CORNER
        emptyline = self.VERTICAL + self.EMPTY * (length - 2) + self.VERTICAL
        return [topbottom] + [emptyline] * (length - 2) + [topbottom]

    # Special case with corner points.
    # quarter == 0 is used because quarter 0 is the special case holding the poles.
    if appearance == 0:
        top = self.CORNER + self.HORIZONTAL * (length - 2) + (self.POINT if self.quarter == 0 else self.CORNER)
        bottom = (self.POINT if self.quarter == 0 else self.CORNER) + self.HORIZONTAL * (length - 2) + self.POINT
        emptyline = self.VERTICAL + self.EMPTY * (length - 2) + self.VERTICAL
        return [top] + [emptyline] * (length - 2) + [bottom]

    # Number of points in odd and even lines.
    npoints_even = pow(2, appearance - 1)
    npoints_odd = pow(2, appearance) - 1

    # Number of spaces separating points in the middle
    # for odd and even lines.
    nspaces_odd = pow(2, self.degree - appearance) - 1
    nspaces_even = 2 * nspaces_odd + 1

    # Number of even lines.
    nlines_even = pow(2, appearance - 1) - 1

    # Construct composite strings.
    small_horizontal = self.HORIZONTAL * nspaces_odd
    big_horizontal = self.HORIZONTAL * nspaces_even
    small_empty = self.EMPTY * nspaces_odd
    big_empty = self.EMPTY * nspaces_even

    # Build lines.
    topbottom = self.CORNER + small_horizontal + big_horizontal.join([self.POINT] * npoints_even) + small_horizontal + self.CORNER
    emptylines = [self.VERTICAL + self.EMPTY * (length - 2) + self.VERTICAL] * nspaces_odd
    oddline = self.VERTICAL + small_empty + small_empty.join([self.POINT] * npoints_odd) + small_empty + self.VERTICAL
    evenline = self.VERTICAL + small_empty + big_empty.join([self.POINT] * npoints_even) + small_empty + self.VERTICAL

    # Assemble the quarter this is like str.join but with list
    fulllines = [topbottom] + ([oddline, evenline]) * nlines_even + [oddline, topbottom]
    def joinlines():
        it = iter(fulllines)
        yield next(it)
        for el in it:
            for empty in emptylines:
                yield empty
            yield el

    return list(joinlines())
#+END_SRC

** Generate the final representation

Here are handled the forementioned assembly steps, in the following method:
#+name: Textual quarter methods
#+BEGIN_SRC python :noweb no-export
def repr(self):
    <<Assemble the degrees of appearance>>
    <<Rotate the quarter>>
    <<Apply horizontal compensation>>
#+END_SRC

The =Quarter= class is represented as a list of lines.
To put icing on the cake, we also handle a string version of the representation:
#+name: Textual quarter methods
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def __str__(self):
    return '\n'.join(self.repr())
#+END_SRC

=__str__= is a magic method that is called when a =str= conversion is applied by Python.
Since a =str= conversion is automatically applied in code when =print= is called, code like src_python[:exports code]{print(quarter0)} will be enough to print the representation, which is great syntactic sugar in my opinion.

*** Assemble the degrees of appearance

When we have a list of degrees of appearance, we assemble them together by using:
 - =map= with =raw_string= to create all the text representations
 - =reduce= with =merge_raw_quarters= (the operation merging two quarters together) to combine them into one
#+name: Assemble the degrees of appearance
#+BEGIN_SRC python
if type(self.appearance) is list:
    assembly = reduce(
        self.merge_raw_quarters,
        map(self.raw, self.appearance)
    )
else:
    assembly = self.raw(self.appearance)
#+END_SRC

Using =reduce= here is by no means fast (to execute) but at least it's fast (to code).

To implement =merge_raw_quarters=, we first need to be able to merge two lines together.
With this textual representation, we just have to iterate through the two lines simultaneously and prioritise the point character above every other.
I also output a collision character when two points collide, because that would mean either a repetition in =appearance= or a mistake in =merge_quarter_lines= and I want both failures to be obvious.

#+name: Textual quarter utils
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def merge_quarter_lines(arg):
    left, right = arg
    buffer = []
    for cleft, cright in zip(left, right):
        if cright == Quarter.POINT:
            if cleft in (Quarter.POINT, Quarter.COLLISION):
                buffer += Quarter.COLLISION
            else:
                buffer += Quarter.POINT
        else:
            buffer += cleft
    return ''.join(buffer)
#+END_SRC

The actual merging method simply uses =merge_quarter_lines= to merge every line into a new list:
#+name: Textual quarter methods
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def merge_raw_quarters(self, left, right):
    return list(map(merge_quarter_lines, zip(left, right)))
#+END_SRC

Because =reduce= is no longer a primitive in Python3, it must be imported:
#+name: Textual quarter dependencies
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from functools import reduce
#+END_SRC

*** Rotate the quarter

To put the quarter into the right orientation, we do =quarter= left rotations.
It would be faster, for example, to do one right rotation when =quarter == 3= but there is no need for optimisation right now.
#+name: Rotate the quarter
#+BEGIN_SRC python
for _ in range(self.quarter):
    assembly = rotate_quarter_representation_left(assembly)
#+END_SRC

Rotating the representation left is a succession of two tricks:
 1. Replacing vertical characters with horizontal ones and vice versa.
 2. Replacing lines with columns (that's what =zip(*lines)= does).
#+name: Textual quarter utils
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def rotate_quarter_representation_left(lines):
    replacement = {Quarter.HORIZONTAL: Quarter.VERTICAL,
                   Quarter.VERTICAL: Quarter.HORIZONTAL}
    def replace(sequence):
        return ''.join(
            replacement[char] if char in replacement
            else char
            for char in sequence
        )
    return [newline for newline in map(replace, zip(*lines))]
#+END_SRC

*** Apply horizontal compensation

Applying horizontal compensation is a must because vertical text space is roughly twice as big as horizontal text space, so the representation is excessively vertical:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval no-export :exports both
<<Textual quarter>>
print('\n'.join(Quarter(2).raw(2)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_src text
+x-x+
|xxx|
|x x|
|xxx|
+x-x+
#+END_src

Vertical compensation is the last step to produce the final representation so we are ready to return:
#+name: Apply horizontal compensation
#+BEGIN_SRC python
return horizontal_compensation(assembly)
#+END_SRC


The horizontal compensation function simply pads the top and bottom lines with horizontal characters and the other lines with empty characters.
#+name: Textual quarter utils
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def horizontal_compensation(lines):
    buffer = [Quarter.HORIZONTAL.join(lines[0])]       # Top.
    for line in lines[1:-1]:
        buffer.append(Quarter.EMPTY.join(line))        # Others.
    buffer.append(Quarter.HORIZONTAL.join(lines[-1]))  # Bottom.
    return buffer
#+END_SRC

Now the text representation looks much better:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval no-export :exports both
<<Textual quarter>>
print('\n'.join(horizontal_compensation(Quarter(2).raw(2))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_src text
+-x---x-+
| x x x |
| x   x |
| x x x |
+-x---x-+
#+END_src
