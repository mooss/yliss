This is supposed to become one day a procedural planet generator.
For now, this is mostly a literate programing OpenGL sandbox (see [[file:graphics.org]], [[file:window.org]]) and a pretty logo generator (see [[file:octasierp.org]] and the picture below).

** Files included from other projects

Some files from external dependencies are included directly in this repository.
The projects from which files were borrowed are the following:
 - glad (https://glad.dav1d.de) :: Since this is an OpenGL loader generator, I figured that the best way to use it would be to directly include the generated code.

** Documents generation

Currently, pdfs can be generated with =make pdf=.

While those pdfs read ok, document generation is missing some features.
Some work is still needed either in the form of pandoc filters or of custom pre-processing steps.
Notable missing features are:
 - Display code block names.
 - Display code blocks dependencies.
 - Optionally comment noweb inclusions.

Here are features that have been implemented:
 - Export some code blocks within minipages.

** TODO Tangler

A tangler is a program that can extract source code blocks from a literate document and gather (tangle) them into their destination file.

This project needs one, ideally one that is written in C/C++ without external dependencies and one that supports =noweb-ref= so that rules out Worgle at least.

Currently lithel's =include.pl= has been adapted to perform some tangling duties but this whole script is an ugly hack that will come back to haunt me.
