* Documents generation

Currently, pdfs can be generated with =make pdf=, although some resources are missing because they are supposed to be generated with code that can't currently be tangled, as explained in the next section.

These resources can be generated within emacs.

Beyond that, proper document generation would require some work, either in the form of pandoc filters or of a custom pre-processing step.
Notable missing elements are:
 - Display code block names.
 - Display code blocks dependencies.
 - Optionally comment noweb inclusions.

* TODO Tangler

This project needs a tangler, one that is written in C/C++ and that supports =noweb-ref= so that rules out Worgle at least.
