* Documents generation

Currently, pdfs can be generated with =make pdf=, although some resources are missing because they are supposed to be generated with code that can't currently be tangled, as explained in the next section.

These resources can be generated within emacs.

* TODO Tangler

This project needs a tangler, one that is written in C/C++ and that supports =noweb-ref= so that rules out Worgle at least.
